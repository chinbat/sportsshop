17,Injured Neymar out of World Cup,A,2,0,"BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil –  Even without Neymar, Brazil's show must go on.  The World Cup hosts, now forced to play without their injured superstar, will face Germany on Tuesday for a spot in next weekend's final.  Neymar fractured a vertebra in his lower back in Brazil's quarterfinal win over Colombia, ruling him out for the rest of the tournament. But despite having to stay off the field, the 22-year-old striker with the dyed-blonde fauxhawk is still expecting Brazil to win its sixth World Cup title.  ""I won't be able to fulfill the dream of playing in a World Cup final,"" Neymar said, ""but I'm sure they will win this one, they will become champions, and I will be there with them, and all of Brazil will be celebrating together.""  Along with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar was among the biggest stars at the World Cup. And in Brazil, the man in the yellow No. 10 jersey is something of a megastar, with his face plastered on billboards around the country and constantly shown.",/media/images/neymar.jpg
14,A Creative Algeria Surprises but Cannot Defeat Germany,A,2,0,"Sofiane Feghouli then sliced through the Germany back line only to miscue his cross from a brilliant position, Slimani's diving header was correctly disallowed for offside and Ghoulam steamed through on the left but lashed his finish across goal and wide. Germany eventually managed to exert an influence - Ozil's misdirected cross was tipped over the bar, Muller headed wide and keeper Rais Mbolhi spilled an Ozil drive - but Algeria refused to sit back and Mehdi Mostefa was the latest to come close with a strike that was deflected wide. Mbolhi made a magnificent double save from Toni Kroos and Mario Gotze as Germany finished the half well, but it was no surprise when Gotze was replaced by Schurrle at the break. The big question was whether Algeria would maintain their intensity or be punished for their missed chances and the answer nearly arrived when Schurrle's effort was deflected narrowly off target, before Shkodran Mustafi headed at Mbolhi and the goalkeeper pulled off a fine save.",/media/images/germanycup-master675.jpg

13,LeBron did triple double,A,1,0,"The Heat were in the mix for James again this time around. Team president Pat Riley traveled to Las Vegas to meet with James on Wednesday in an attempt to lure him back to Miami after the All-Star opted out of his contract following the team's NBA Finals loss to the San Antonio Spurs.  But James said no to Riley and the Heat, instead choosing a Cleveland team that picked him No. 1 overall in the 2003 draft out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, where he starred as a high school player in his native Akron, Ohio.  ""Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was a kid from Northeast Ohio. It's where I walked,"" James told SI.com. ""It's where I ran. It's where I cried. It's where I bled.

I want to inspire them when I can.""",/media/images/lebron.jpg
10,Suarez banned for 9 international games,A,2,0,"The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has reached a decision in the case related to Luis Suárez of Uruguay following an incident that occurred during the FIFA World Cup™ match between Italy and Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

20,Free Agent Center Pau Gasol Signs With Bulls,A,1,0,"The 34-year-old Gasol has had some injury problems the past few seasons and declined defensively, but he remains a unique talent offensively, with an array of post moves, the ability to hit the mid-range jumper and deft passing touch. He averaged 17.4 points and 9.7 rebounds last season. The Spaniard won two NBA championships while with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010. Multiple reports indicated the Bulls and Lakers were working on a sign-and-trade deal for Gasol, but an agreement wasn’t reached. A sign-and-trade would have meant the Bulls could pay Gasol more money and keep their mid-level exception to use on Nikola Mirotic or another player. Instead, the Bulls will have to use salary cap space to sign Gasol. Currently, they’re over the cap but can get under it by trading Carlos Boozer or using the amnesty provision on him. That would open up about $10 million in cap space.",/media/images/gasol.jpg
21,Magical Goetze eclipses Messi as Germany win Cup,A,2,0,"The magical strike meant Germany became the only European team to win the World Cup in the Americas, and left the superlative Messi without the title he so craved to crown his glittering career.  ""All of Germany is world champion now,"" the winners' immense goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said. ""We're going to celebrate for at least five weeks now. At some point we'll stop celebrating but we'll always keep waking up with a smile.""  It will be a richly deserved smile.  As much as all of Argentina hankered for a triumph on Brazilian soil, Germany were worth their win over a subdued Messi and his team mates who counter-attacked dangerously but lacked their opponents' more fluid passing moves.  Messi's poor final was summed up with virtually the last kick of the game when he had a chance to score a sensational equalizer with a free-kick 30 meters out.  The world's best player never troubled the world's best goalkeeper, however, blasting his effort high and wide and seconds later Germany.",/media/images/germany.jpg
22,Novak Djokovic wins Wimbledon title,A,3,0,"It was Djokovic's seventh Grand Slam title and broke a streak of three consecutive losses in major finals and in five of his past six.  In the last set, Djokovic broke in the final game with the help of four mistakes by Federer to seal the win.  After the players met at the net, Djokovic went to the middle of the court, knelt down and plucked out a piece of grass and ate it, similar to what he did in 2011 when he won his first title here.  Trailing 5-4 in the fourth set, Federer double-faulted to make it 30-30. He then put a backhand into the net to set up a championship point for Djokovic.  The 32-year-old Federer then hit a serve that was ruled out, but he challenged it and the Hawk-Eye replay showed that it hit the line for an ace -- one of his 29 in the match. Federer went on to break in the next game before forcing a fifth set.",/media/images/djokovic.jpg
